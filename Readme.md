## Introduction

Our application is called JACE. JACE, also known as Java And Croissant Express, is our solution to modernizing the fast-dining experience, with an application that can host user data, menu items, provide a virtual menu with information for users, and let them order food to their table.

JACE is a full-stack MERN application that many restaurants will be able to use as a template, so long as they replace the default JACE branding and menu items, with their own.

## Features

- Feature 1: Front-end User experience with a given restauraunts branding, menu items, and the ability to order food right to their table. 
- Feature 2: A Kitchen view, allowing restauraunts to update order status' and keep track of multiple orders
- Feature 3: Integrated payment handling with stripe, and receipt generation with EmailJS
- ...

## Installation

### Accessing the Web Application

JACE is a web-based application in its current state. To start see the mock up restauraunt that JACE is supporting (also called JACE for the sake of demonstration), simply visit the following URL: 

https://jace1971.herokuapp.com/.

From there, you can create an account, log in, and begin enjoying the fast-dining experience JACE has to offer.

### Downloading locally 
If a restauraunt wishes to utilize the JACE template for their own restauraunt, they can do the following: 

If a restaurant wishes to utilize the JACE template for their own establishment, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository or clone it from this repo:

```
https://github.com/cdennis27/JACE
```

2. Open the folder in a code editor like Visual Studio Code.

3. Open the root folder in an integrated terminal.

4. Enter the following commands to install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

5. To build and seed the project, run the following commands:

```
npm run build
npm run seed
```

6. For testing, use the command:

```
npm run develop
```

This allows users to modify files locally to fit their own branding. Please note that you will need a Stripe account for payment processing, as well as an EmailJS account for automated email sending to users.

**Important:** If you wish to use JACE for your business (as a template for your own personal menu and branding), we kindly ask you to obtain permission first. We will provide all necessary assistance to get it up and running!
